# SheetRegister

`SheetRegister` component allows you to register multiple sheets in one place. This is especially useful when you have many sheets in your app.

```tsx
import {SheetRegister} from 'react-native-actions-sheet';
import ExampleSheet from 'example-sheet.tsx';
export const Sheets = () => {
  return <SheetRegister sheets={{'example-sheet': ExampleSheet}} />;
};
```

In `App.tsx` import `Sheets` component and wrap your app in `SheetProvider`.

```tsx
import {SheetProvider} from 'react-native-actions-sheet';
import {Sheets} from 'sheets.tsx';
function App() {
  return (
    <SheetProvider>
      <Sheets />
      {
        // your app components
      }
    </SheetProvider>
  );
}
```

The way we were registering sheets earlier felt a bit hacky so this new way is much cleaner and easier to manage when you have many sheets in the app.

## Props

An object containing the sheets to register. The key is the sheet ID and the value is the sheet component.
