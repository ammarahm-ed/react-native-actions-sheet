# Using ActionSheet router

ActionSheet comes with a tiny router for navigation between different routes in an ActionSheet. This is useful for making different flows in your app without the need to open/close different ActionSheets.

You can say that using a router is like having one Sheet that can replace multiple Sheets in your app with routes.

Router works like any navigation router in your app.

```tsx
import ActionSheet, {
  Route,
  RouteScreenProps,
  useSheetRouter,
  useSheetRouteParams,
} from 'react-native-actions-sheet';

const RouteA = ({router}: RouteScreenProps) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Go to Route B"
        onPress={() => {
          router.navigate('route-b', {data: 'test'});
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const RouteB = () => {
  const router = useSheetRouter();
  const params = useSheetRouteParams();

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Go Back to Route A"
        onPress={() => {
          router.goBack();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    name: 'route-a',
    component: RouteA,
  },
  {
    name: 'route-b',
    component: RouteB,
  },
];

function Sheet(props: SheetProps) {
  return (
    <ActionSheet
      enableRouterBackNavigation={true}
      routes={routes}
      initialRoute="route-a"
    />
  );
}

export default Sheet;
```
