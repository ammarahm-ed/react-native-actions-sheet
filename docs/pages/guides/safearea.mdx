# Handling SafeArea

There are two main props that will come in handy when dealing with `SafeArea` in the action sheet.

The first one is `useBottomSafeAreaPadding`. This prop uses the top padding as a reference to calculate the bottom padding on mobile to Views do not hide under the Navigation Bar.

```tsx
<ActionSheet useBottomSafeAreaPadding />
```

The second one is `drawUnderStatusBar`. This is useful for action sheets that cover full screen. In that case, the sheet will grow under the StatusBar by default. However you can set this to `false` if you don't want that default behavior.

```tsx
<ActionSheet drawUnderStatusBar={false} />
```
