# Installation

Install the ActionSheet with your favorite package installer. I am going to use `npm`.

```fish
npm install react-native-actions-sheet --save
```

The library depends on `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-safe-area-context` so make sure these are installed too.

```fish
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context  --save
```
You are all set to use the ActionSheet in your project! 🎉
