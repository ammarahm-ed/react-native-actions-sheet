# Installation

Install the ActionSheet with your favorite package manager:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install react-native-actions-sheet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add react-native-actions-sheet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add react-native-actions-sheet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add react-native-actions-sheet
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The library depends on `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-safe-area-context` so make sure these are installed too.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You are all set to use the ActionSheet in your project! 🎉
